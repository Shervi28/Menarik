 Inspired by recent research that revealed
associations between the brain and the large computational language models, we
propose a generative language BCI that utilizes the capacity of a large
language model (LLM) jointly with a semantic brain decoder to directly generate
language from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) input.
